# Hardware_Inventory
This Excel-based inventory system was designed to track, analyze, and visualize stock levels of construction materials and sanitary hardware in real-time. It uses a combination of pivot tables, bar charts, pie charts, and conditional formatting to help identify high-value items, low-stock risks, and supplier-wise distribution of materials.
